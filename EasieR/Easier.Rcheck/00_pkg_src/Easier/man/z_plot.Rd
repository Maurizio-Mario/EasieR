\title{Building a function to translate a score from distribution in a z-score graph.}
\usage{
z_plot(x, myMean, mySd, p = 0, title = "", y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{is the score of interest from a given distribution.}

\item{myMean}{is the mean of the given distribution.}

\item{mySd}{is the standard deviation of the given distribution.}

\item{p}{default zero, it is called for plotting and calculating}

\item{main}{it should give a desired title to the plot}
}
\value{
a plot stressing the corresponding z-score of the input data.
}
\description{
This function is thought for the chapter 6 on Standard Normal distributions. It allows to rapidly draw a plot with Lattice representing a Standard normal distribution translating the inputs for a generic normal distribution. Furthermore, it allows to stress out cumulative probability distributions if necessary.
}
\details{
the function is actually under development.
